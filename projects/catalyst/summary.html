					Catalyst was a game that was created as part of my Major Qualifying
					Project (MQP) at WPI, titled "Catalyst - Using Hitbox Scaling for Latency
					Compensation in a Cloud Based Game." The goal of the project was to create
					and implement a latency compensation technique in a custom game, which was
					to be deployed on Google Stadia. The idea behind this technique was to
					maintain player accuracy and quality of experience in spite of a player's
					latency. The project itself was sponsored by Google, who provided feedback
					on our work and the ability to deploy our game to Google Stadia for testing.
					<br><br>
					The team that I was a part of decided to create a multiplayer first person
					shooter called Catalyst. The idea was to have players cast spells at each other,
					rather than using guns like in many other FPS titles. Player can combine three
					different elements for a total of 10 unique spells in a Capture-the-Flag
					multiplayer arena.
					<br><br>
					Since I have always been a big fan of multiplayer first person shooters like
					Halo, Destiny, etc., I decided to work on the networking aspects of the game in
					order to learn more about how multiplayer games are structured and how I, as a game
					programmer, and create them. I started by learning about how to make a basic
					multiplayer game in Unreal Engine 4, which taught me the fundamentals of multiplayer
					works in the engine, such as the peer-to-peer architecture, how to create a lobby,
					connect other players through Steam matchmaking, and placing players into a match
					once everyone was ready. From there, I took that knowledge and worked on the other
					networking aspects of the game as well, such as updating match state across all player
					(like when a flag was captured) and adding features like being able to choose your
					team in the lobby. I created AI bots that would act as teammates for
					players, with behaviors for going after the other team's flag, bringing it home once
					they grabbed it, protecting allies who are carrying an enemy flag, and attacking
					enemies who are stealing their flag. Additionally, I created the main menu and
					helped my teammates debug any multiplayer-related issues.
					<br><br>
					Since no one on the team was a game artist, we used previously created assets from the
					Unreal marketplace, many of which came from the game Paragon, which was created by Epic
					Games but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/paragon">
					after cancellation released the assets for free online.</a>
					<br><br>
					The game went through multiple stages of development. We first created a small
					demo, which was a single player game in which the player would throw fireballs
					at a moving NPC target. We gave this demo to a another group of student researchers,
					who ran a user study to determine how much hitbox scaling should be supplied in
					response to player latency to achieve a desired accuracy. We also brought the game
					to WPI's alphafest, where other students were able to playtest the game and provide
					feedback. Finally, we ran our own user study with the final version of the game on
					Google Stadia, where we measured player accuracy in response to artificially induced
					latency with hitbox scaling on and off. These results were written in a final report
					and presentation that we gave to Google.
