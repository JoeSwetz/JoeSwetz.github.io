					<h1>Lift-Off Laetus</h1>

				<p>
					One of my final game development projects at Worcester Polytechnic Institute was for a class 
					called Technical Game Development II. The class was taught alongside an advanced game art class, 
					where the professors put students from each class into development teams, each with about
					2-3 artists and 2-3 programmers. The group I was part of ended up created Lift-Off Laetus!
					<br><br>
					Lift-Off Laetus is a turned-based strategy game that takes place on the planet Laetus. Two
					teams of space-farers have crash landed on the planet and must fight for limited resources to fix
					their own ship and make it home. Both players control a team of three crew members. The game takes 
					place on a grid of squares, and on each turn the player can move their crew around the board, 
					attacking other players and collecting resources for their ship. The first team to collect three 
					crates wins!
					<br><br>
					Development of the game was chronicled on our development team website, which you can find 
					<a href="https://used-unicycle-usurpers.github.io/website/index.html" class="link">here</a>.
					You'll find links to download the alpha and beta versions of the game, our final class presentation
					and our dev blog with weekly updates from the art and tech teams, giving insight into the development
					proess alongside screenshots of our work.
					<br><br>
					I personally worked on the programming side of things for this game with 3 other members on the tech team. 
					The game was developed in Unreal Engine 4 using C++. One of the biggest parts of the game that I developed 
					was the underlying mechanism for spawning the grid of squares on top  of the terrain developed by the art 
					team. I wanted to give us as much flexiblity as possible with regards to how we could set up the board, 
					since things were likely to change quickly over the 7 week development period. On startup, the game reads 
					the topology of the board from a config file and spawns the grid tiles on top of the terrain (so if the art 
					team changes the landscape, the tiles would adjust automatically). The config file also specifies the location 
					of obstacles, resources boxes, powerups, and holes in the grid. From an object-oriented perspective, this also
					made it simple to set up individual objects for each tile, which alloed to trach properties such the player
					standing on that tile and whether an effect had been applied to that tile by a crew member's ability.
					<br><br>
					I also worked on the input system for the game. Since we were develpoing a local multiplayer game
					during a period of remote learning during the Covid-19 pandemic, we had the challenge of figuring out
					how to test the game when no one could be in the same room. To get our alpha up and running, we had one
					player used the keyboard, while the other had to plug in a controller. During the alpha testing
					this became a pain point for some players (all testers had to play both sides on their own since we were
					all at home), especially those who did not have a controller to plug in. Therefore, in the final version of
					the game I created a more flexible input system that allowed the players to either use a single keyword
					(with one player using WASD and the other using arrow keys), or to plug in a controller for the second
					player. The player can choose their preferred input option from the main menu.
					<br><br>
					Additionally, I also worked on intergrating the art team's assets into the game. I was already very 
					experienced with Unreal Engine 4 at the time due to my work on Catalyst and 33 Alder Ridge, so I was able
					to help the art team import their, where I could then attach them to characters, and carrying out animations
					in the game's C++ code.
					<br><br>
					Finally, I helped polish the game by fixing bugs, setting up a main menu, and creating a victory cinematic
					when a teams wins the game.
